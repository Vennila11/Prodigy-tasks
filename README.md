# Prodigy-tasks
Grateful for the Opportunity with Prodigy!

I am thrilled to share that I recently completed an enriching 1-month internship with Prodigy in the Machine Learning domain. This journey has been both challenging and rewarding, providing me with valuable insights and hands-on experience with various Machine Learning algorithms.

Throughout the internship, This is how I worked productively on several exciting tasks:

Week 1: Linear Regression
- Developed a House Price Prediction Model, learning how to implement and fine-tune linear regression algorithms to predict housing prices accurately.

Week 2: K-means Clustering
- Grouped retail store customers based on their purchase patterns using K-means clustering, gaining a deep understanding of unsupervised learning and data segmentation.

Week 3: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Built an Image Classifier for cats and dogs, exploring the complexities of SVMs and enhancing my skills in image recognition and classification.

Week 4: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Created a Hand Gesture Recognition Model, utilizing CNNs to identify and classify various hand gestures from the dataset, furthering my knowledge in deep learning and computer vision.

I am immensely grateful to Prodigy for this incredible opportunity and for the knowledge and experience I have gained. Looking forward to applying these skills in future projects.
